    "ideaTitle": "Comprehensive notification system overhaul",
    "ideaBody": "OK so I've been thinking about this for a while and I have a lot of ideas. First, we need to fix the email notifications because they're unreliable - sometimes they arrive late, sometimes not at all. Second, we should add push notifications for mobile users who have installed the PWA. Third, we need in-app notifications with a notification center where users can see all their past notifications. Fourth, we should add notification preferences so users can choose which notifications they want to receive and how (email, push, in-app, or SMS). Fifth, we need to support notification digests - instead of getting 50 emails a day, users should be able to opt into a daily or weekly summary. Sixth, notification templates should be customizable by admins. Seventh, we need real-time notifications using WebSockets so users see updates without refreshing. Eighth, we should track notification delivery and open rates. Ninth, we need to handle notification throttling to prevent spam. Tenth, we should support rich notifications with images and action buttons. Also, I forgot to mention that we need to handle quiet hours where notifications are suppressed. And we should have a way to mark all notifications as read. Oh and notification sounds would be nice too. And maybe notification categories or channels like Slack has. Basically just make notifications amazing.",

    "ideaTitle": "Add retry logic to API calls",
    "ideaBody": "Our API calls fail sometimes and we just show an error. We should add retry logic like this:\n\n```typescript\nasync function fetchWithRetry(url: string, retries = 3) {\n  for (let i = 0; i < retries; i++) {\n    try {\n      return await fetch(url);\n    } catch (e) {\n      if (i === retries - 1) throw e;\n      await sleep(1000 * Math.pow(2, i));\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nMaybe with exponential backoff.
