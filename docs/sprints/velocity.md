# Sprint Velocity

Track sprint-over-sprint performance to calibrate future sprint sizing.

| Sprint | Date | Goal | Planned | Done | Carry | ~Hours | Issues/Hr | Notes |
|--------|------|------|---------|------|-------|--------|-----------|-------|
| 1 | 2026-02-27 | Add validation, retry tracking, error messages | 3 | 2 | 1 | ~0.25 | 8.0 | First sprint — 1 issue blocked by unrelated test timeout |

## How to Read This

- **Planned**: Issues committed to the sprint during planning
- **Done**: Issues completed and moved to Done
- **Carry**: Issues carried over to next sprint (Planned - Done)
- **~Hours**: Approximate time spent (session duration)
- **Issues/Hr**: Done / Hours — velocity metric

## Velocity Trends

> Update this section after accumulating 3+ sprints of data.

- **Average velocity**: TBD issues/hr
- **Best sprint type**: TBD
- **Recommended sprint size**: 7 issues (adjust based on data)
| 1 | 2026-02-27 | First sprint — no historical velocity, capped at 3 issues. All 3 S1-designated issues are independent tasks with clear acceptance criteria. No stakeholder-priority or bug issues to override ordering. All run in a single parallel group since they have no dependencies on each other. | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 | 7.25 | undefined |
