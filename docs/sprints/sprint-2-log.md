# Sprint 2 Log — 2026-02-28

**Goal**: All 5 eligible issues are type:chore process improvements from Sprint 1 retrospective — no priority:critical/high or type:bug issues exist. No dependencies between issues, so all run in a single parallel group. 2 additional open issues (#182, #183) were excluded because they lack type:* labels and need backlog grooming. Sprint 1 velocity (6 done / 8 planned) sets capacity baseline; 5 issues with 20% buffer fits comfortably.
**Planned**: 5 issues
