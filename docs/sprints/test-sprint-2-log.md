# Test Sprint 2 Log — 2026-02-27

**Goal**: All 4 eligible issues are type:chore from Sprint 1 retro. Selected 3, deferred #160 (quality gate improvement) as it's larger scope and #159 addresses the immediate symptom. #162 (carryover resolution) sequenced after #159 because it needs the flaky ws-server.test.ts fixed before the quality gate can pass. #159 and #161 are independent and run in parallel as Group 1.
**Planned**: 3 issues
